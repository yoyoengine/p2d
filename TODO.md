# TODO

actually call callbacks

attune deltatime for debugger so you can do more than one frame

friction!

## notes/divergences

- noticed that 2bit does not scale inv masses along normal dotted with normal, he just adds them to J?
- i do NOT divide by contact count, like 2bit does

future:

- add joints!!

add culling frame to force inactive objects to sleep
